# Search algorithms

Search is an integral part of AI. It helps in problem solving across a wide variety of domains where a solution isn’t immediately clear. You will implement several graph search algorithms with the goal of solving bi-directional and tri-directional search.

In this section we will discuss some search algorithms like BFS, DFS, Uniform cost search,A* search, Bi directional search.

We will introduce the concept of heuristic in search while dealing with search algorithms like A* search. In mathematical optimization and computer science, heuristic (from Greek εὑρίσκω "I find, discover") is a technique designed for solving a problem more quickly when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution. This is achieved by trading optimality, completeness, accuracy, or precision for speed. In a way, it can be considered a shortcut.

A heuristic function, also simply called a heuristic, is a function that ranks alternatives in search algorithms at each branching step based on available information to decide which branch to follow. For example, it may approximate the exact solution.
